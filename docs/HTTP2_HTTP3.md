# HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 Support

This document explains the HTTP protocol options available for the Vibe application.

## Current Support

### HTTP/2 (Enabled by Default)

HTTP/2 is automatically enabled when using HTTPS in the signaling server with the following features:

- **Multiplexing**: Multiple requests/responses over a single TCP connection
- **Header Compression**: HPACK compression reduces overhead
- **Server Push**: Server can proactively send resources
- **Binary Protocol**: More efficient parsing than HTTP/1.1 text protocol

HTTP/2 is used automatically when:

1. HTTPS is configured (HTTP/2 requires TLS)
2. Running with `pnpm dev:https`

To disable HTTP/2 and use HTTP/1.1 with TLS:

1. Set `USE_HTTP2=false` in `apps/signaling/.env.development`
2. Restart the server

### Verifying HTTP/2

You can verify HTTP/2 is working by:

1. Open Chrome DevTools â†’ Network tab
2. Right-click on column headers and enable "Protocol"
3. Look for "h2" in the Protocol column (HTTP/2)

## HTTP/3 Options

HTTP/3 (QUIC) is not yet natively supported by Node.js, but here are your options:

### Option 1: Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended for Production)

Use Cloudflare Tunnel to get HTTP/3 support without changing your application:

```bash
# Install cloudflared
brew install cloudflared

# Create a tunnel
cloudflared tunnel --url https://localhost:4000
```

Benefits:
- Automatic HTTP/3 support
- No application changes needed
- Production-ready solution
- Free for development

### Option 2: Caddy Reverse Proxy (Local Development)

Use Caddy as a reverse proxy with HTTP/3 support:

1. Install Caddy:
```bash
brew install caddy
```

2. Create a Caddyfile:
```
localhost:443 {
    reverse_proxy localhost:4000
    tls internal
    protocols h3 h2 h1
}
```

3. Run Caddy:
```bash
caddy run
```

### Option 3: NGINX with HTTP/3 (Advanced)

Compile NGINX with HTTP/3 support (requires building from source with BoringSSL).

### Option 4: Node.js QUIC Libraries (Experimental)

Experimental libraries like `node-quic` or `@nodejs/quic` are available but not production-ready.

## Performance Comparison

| Protocol | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| HTTP/1.1 | Wide support, simple | Head-of-line blocking, no multiplexing |
| HTTP/2 | Multiplexing, header compression, server push | TCP head-of-line blocking |
| HTTP/3 | UDP-based (no HOL blocking), faster handshakes | Limited server support, newer protocol |

## Recommendations

1. **Development**: HTTP/2 is sufficient and well-supported
2. **Production**: Consider Cloudflare Tunnel for automatic HTTP/3
3. **Future**: Wait for native Node.js HTTP/3 support (in development)

## WebSocket Considerations

- WebSockets work over HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
- HTTP/3 doesn't support WebSocket protocol directly
- Socket.IO automatically falls back to supported transports
- For HTTP/3, consider WebTransport (future standard)

## Next.js Specific

Next.js 15 supports HTTP/2 when using:
- `next start` in production mode
- Custom server with HTTP/2 support
- Deployment platforms like Vercel (automatic HTTP/3)

For local development with `next dev`, HTTP/2 support is limited but the `--experimental-https` flag enables HTTPS.
